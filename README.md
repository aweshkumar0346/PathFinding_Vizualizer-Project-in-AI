# PathFinding_Vizualizer-Project-in-AI
Project Title: PathFinding Visualizer

Description:
The PathFinding Visualizer project is an interactive platform designed to visualize three essential pathfinding algorithms: A* Algorithm, Greedy Algorithm, and Breadth-First Search (BFS). These algorithms play crucial roles in fields like robotics, gaming, and navigation systems. Implemented in Python, the project leverages the Tkinter library for a graphical user interface (GUI) and a custom module named "grid" for managing grid functionalities.

The primary objectives of this project are to implement A*, Greedy, and BFS algorithms for pathfinding, develop a user-friendly GUI for easy interaction and visualization, and provide customization options for configuring the start and end points, obstacles, and grid dimensions. Real-time visualization is a key feature, illustrating the execution process of each algorithm to enhance understanding and learning.

Technologies used include Python for algorithmic implementation and GUI development, and a custom Grid Module ("grid.py") to manage grid-related functionalities. The project serves as an educational tool, enabling hands-on learning and understanding of fundamental pathfinding algorithms. It emphasizes the importance of heuristic search techniques and graph traversal methodologies in addressing real-world challenges. Future enhancements may include additional algorithm integrations, performance optimization, and UI refinements to further improve the user experience.
